## Learning Journey

As a beginner in the world of programming, I embarked on this project as part of my exploration into the fundamentals of Python. The book played a pivotal role in my learning experience, providing clear explanations, hands-on exercises, and practical projects like this one.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (install using `pip install pygame`)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alien-invasion.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
